                    CONTENT




          INTRODUCTION

          THE TIME SHARING SUBSYSTEM OPTION (TSSO) IS A PACKAGE DESIGNED TO
          INCREASE  OPERATIONS  AND END USER PRODUCTIVITY BY PROVIDING TSO-
          LIKE SERVICES TO THE MVS OPERATOR, AND MVS  CONSOLE  SERVICES  TO
          THE TSO AND NCCF USER. TSSO CAN GREATLY ENHANCE AN INSTALLATION'S
          EFFORTS TO EFFICIENTLY CONTROL AND OPERATE MVS BY AUTOMATING MOST
          OPERATIONAL  PROCEDURES.   THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE CHANGES TO
          TSSO IN VERSION 4, RELEASE  3.  KNOWLEDGE  OF  TSSO  CONCEPTS  IS
          ASSUMED.1

          VERSION  4.3  OF  THE  TIME  SHARING  SUBSYSTEM  OPTION  PROVIDES
          ENHANCEMENTS  OVER  THE PREVIOUS RELEASE IN FIVE MAIN AREAS. THEY
          ARE:

            1.  ENHANCEMENTS  TO  THE  OPERATIONS   PRODUCTIVITY   FACILITY
                (TSSO/OPF). THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA
                OF INCREASED AUTOMATION CAPABILITY THROUGH  EXPANDED  CLIST
                ORIENTED  TSSO COMMANDS, AND THE REMOVAL OF THE RESTRICTION
                OF ONLY ONE OUTSTANDING OSCMD IN THE SYSTEM.

            2.  ENHANCEMENTS   TO   THE   AUTOMATED   OPERATIONS   FACILITY
                (TSSO/AOF). THESE ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDE EASE OF USE FEATURES
                FOR SYSTEM  PROGRAMMERS  AND  OPERATORS  DEALING  WITH  THE
                TSSO/AOF COMPONENT.

            3.  THE ADDITION OF AN INTERFACE TO THE NETWORK  COMMUNICATIONS
                CONTROL  FACILITY (NCCF). THIS INTERFACE ALLOWS THE NETWORK
                OPERATOR TO ISSUE MVS, JES2 OR  OTHER  SUBSYSTEM  COMMANDS,
                AND RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE AT THE NCCF TERMINAL.

            4.  THE TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY FEATURE HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO  USE
                THE  SYSTEM  ACCESS  FACILITY FOR ITS INTERFACE TO SECURITY
                SYSTEMS.

            5.  NUMEROUS RAS (RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILITY)
                ENHANCEMENTS, TO PROVIDE GREATER TSSO STABILITY.

          EACH OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS WILL NOW BE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY.

          ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY
          FACILITY:

            1.  TSSO NOW ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE SIMULTANEOUS  CALLER  OF  THE
                OSCMD  TSO  COMMAND. THE INSTALLATION DEFINES THE NUMBER OF
                SIMULTANEOUS CALLERS IN THE NEW NUMCONS  PARAMETER  IN  THE
                TSSO  INITIALIZATION  DECK.  INSTALLATIONS  MUST DEFINE ONE
                SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE TO MVS FOR EVERY SIMULTANEOUS  CALLER  OF
                OSCMD.  IN ADDITION, AN INSTALLATION MAY CHOOSE TO DEDICATE
                ONE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE FOR THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE.  THIS  IS
                ACCOMPLISHED  THROUGH  A  DEDICATE PARAMETER ON THE NUMCONS
                STATEMENT. TSSO 4.3 PROVIDES AN EXPANDED  OPERATOR  COMMAND
                (#.Q SCON) TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES.
                THIS WILL ALLOW AN INSTALLATION TO DETERMINE WHO  IS  USING
                THE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES, AND HOW MANY ARE NEEDED.

            2.  THE OSCMD COMMAND HAS BEEN REWRITTEN FOR TSSO 4.3.  IT  NOW
                SUPPORTS  THE  CAPABILITY  TO  DIRECT  THE  RESPONSE  OF AN
                OPERATING SYSTEM, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM COMMAND TO

                  1.  A TSO TERMINAL - IF  OSCMD  WAS  ISSUED  FROM  A  TSO
                      ADDRESS SPACE.

                  2.  THE MVS CONSOLE -  IF  OSCMD  WAS  PART  OF  A  CLIST
                      INITIATED FROM THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE.

                  3.  CLIST VARIABLES - IF OSCMD WAS ISSUED FROM A CLIST.

                THE REDIRECTION  OF  MVS  COMMAND  OUTPUT  IS  ACCOMPLISHED
                THROUGH  A CLIST VARIABLE (CMDRESP), WHICH IS USED AS INPUT
                TO OSCMD.

                OSCMD NOW SUPPORTS A USER EXIT, TO ALLOW AN INSTALLATION TO
                CODE  A  ROUTINE  TO  DETERMINE THE MVS COMMAND GROUP LEVEL
                (E.G. SYSTEM, I/O, MASTER OR INFO) THE TSO USER IS  ALLOWED
                TO  ISSUE.  THE  DEFAULT  VERSION OF THE OSCMDATH USER EXIT
                ALLOWS THE TSO USER THE AUTHORITY  OF  AN  MVS  INFORMATION
                ONLY  CONSOLE,  UNLESS  THE X'C0' BITS ARE TURNED ON IN THE
                USERDATA FIELD OF THE TSO USER'S UADS ENTRY.  THIS  MAY  BE
                DONE   THROUGH   THE   USERDATA  PARAMETER  OF  THE  CHANGE
                SUBCOMMAND IN TSO ACCOUNT.

            3.  A NEW COMMAND, OSWAIT, IS INCLUDED IN TSSO 4.3.  OSWAIT  IS
                INTENDED  TO  BE  ISSUED  FROM  THE  CLIST ENVIRONMENT, AND
                ALLOWS THE CLIST TO WAIT FOR A SPECIFIED MESSAGE TO  APPEAR
                ON  THE MVS CONSOLE. THE MESSAGE IS DEFINED IN THE TSSO/AOF
                TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING CLIST WILL START  A  JOB,
                WAIT FOR THE JOB TO COMPLETE, AND PURGE THE JOB.

                     PROC 0
                     /***************************************/
                     /* THIS CLIST WILL START A JOB, WAIT   */
                     /* FOR ITS COMPLETION, AND PURGE THE   */
                     /* JOB.                                */
                     /***************************************/

                     OSCMD S MYJOB
                     OSWAIT ENTRY(MYJOBEND)   TIMEOUT(60)
                     OSWTO MYJOB HAS ENDED...
                     OSCMD $P'MYJOB'
                     EXIT

                NOTE THAT THE TIMEOUT PARAMETER ALLOWS THE CLIST  DEVELOPER
                TO  SPECIFY  HOW  MANY  SECONDS  TO WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE TO
                APPEAR.  THE  FOLLOWING  TSSO/AOF  TABLE  DEFINITION  ENTRY
                SUPPORTS  THE ABOVE CLIST (NOTE THAT IEF404I IS THE MVS JOB
                ENDED MESSAGE).

                   TABENTRY MSG=IEF404I,ACTION=POST,TEST=((W,2,5,'MYJOB',' '))


                THE OSWAIT  COMMAND  PROVIDES  FOR  SIGNIFICANT  AUTOMATION
                OPPORTUNITIES  THAT WERE (IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF TSSO) TOO
                CUMBERSOME TO JUSTIFY DEVELOPMENT.

                OSWAIT DOES NOT NEED TO RUN FROM THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE. IN
                THEORY,   AN  INSTALLATION  MAY  HAVE  MANY  OSWAIT  EVENTS
                OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME,  IN  DIFFERENT  TSO  OR  BATCH
                ADDRESS  SPACES. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIMPLE JOB SCHEDULER CAN BE
                CODED AS A CLIST USING THE  OSWAIT  AND  OSCMD  FACILITIES.
                THIS  CLIST CAN THEN BE RUN UNDER CONTROL OF A BATCH TMP IN
                A SEPARATE ADDRESS SPACE.

                IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH TSSO  DOES  NOT  HAVE  ANY
                FACILITY  FOR  TIMER  DEPENDENT  COMMANDS,  IT  MAY UTILIZE
                EITHER THE JES2 AUTOMATIC COMMAND  FACILITY,  OR  THE  NCCF
                "AT"  AND  "EVERY"  COMMANDS  TO  START  CLISTS AT SPECIFIC
                TIMES, OR AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS.

          ENHANCEMENTS TO THE AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE AUTOMATED  OPERATIONS
          FACILITY (AOF) COMPONENT OF TSSO.

            1.  TSSO 4.3 SUPPORTS A  LABEL  ON  THE  TABENTRY  MACRO.  THIS
                PARAMETER  ALLOWS THE CODER OF THE AOF TABLE TO ASSOCIATE A
                1-8 CHARACTER IDENTIFIER WITH  EACH  TABENTRY  MACRO.  THIS
                IDENTIFIER  CAN  THE BE USED AS A PARAMETER TO THE DISPAOF,
                ALTAOF OR OSWAIT COMMANDS.

            2.  THE DISPAOF COMMAND IS ENHANCED TO DISPLAY  THE  NEW  LABEL
                ASSOCIATED  WITH  THE TABENTRY MACRO.  IT CAN ALSO USE THIS
                LABEL AS AN OPERAND TO THE ENTRYID PARAMETER.  DISPAOF WILL
                DISPLAY  ALL  ENTRIES  THAT  START  WITH  THE  GIVEN  ENTRY
                IDENTIFIER. IN ADDITION, THE MSG PARAMETER OF  THE  DISPAOF
                COMMAND  IS ENHANCED TO DISPLAY ALL ENTRIES THAT START WITH
                THE GIVEN MESSAGE IDENTIFIER, INSTEAD OF THE REQUIREMENT OF
                AN EXACT MATCH. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMMAND

                   DISPAOF ENTRY(VTAMUP)


                WILL DISPLAY ALL TSSO/AOF TABLE  ENTRIES  THAT  HAVE  ENTRY
                IDENTIFIER STARTING WITH "VTAMUP". THE COMMAND


                   DISPAOF MSG($HASP)


                WILL DISPLAY ALL TSSO/AOF TABLE ENTRIES WITH A  MESSAGE  ID
                STARTING WITH $HASP (E.G. ALL JES2 RELATED ENTRIES).

            3.  A NEW CLIST (ASMTAB) IS PROVIDED TO ASSEMBLE AND  LINK-EDIT
                THE  TSSO AOF TABLE. THIS CLIST REDUCES THE CUMBERSOME TASK
                OF PLACING A NEW AOF TABLE INTO PRODUCTION. IT IS  INTENDED
                AS  AN  EXAMPLE,  AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE MODIFIED FOR
                USE  IN  YOUR  INSTALLATION.   THE  CLIST  CAN  ASSEMBLE  A
                MODERATELY  SIZED TABLE, LINK EDIT THE RESULT, AND COPY THE
                RESULTING  LOAD  MODULE  INTO  SYS1.TSSOLOAD  IN  ABOUT  10
                SECONDS.   THE  CLIST  HAS  A RELOAD PARAMETER TO ISSUE THE
                TSSO #.RELOAD COMMAND UPON SUCCESSFUL  ASSEMBLY  AND  LINK-
                EDIT.

            4.  TSSO/AOF SUPPORTS THE OSWAIT  COMMAND  BY  RECOGNIZING  THE
                SPECIFICATION OF ACTION=POST ON THE TABENTRY MACRO.

          ADDITION OF AN INTERFACE TO NCCF

          THE NETWORK COMMUNICATION CONTROL  FACILITY  IS  AN  IBM  PROGRAM
          PRODUCT THAT PROVIDES FOR NETWORK CONTROL IN ACF/VTAM OR ACF/TCAM
          ENVIRONMENTS. THROUGH THE ADDITION OF AN OSCMD COMMAND PROCESSOR,
          NCCF  NOW  SUPPORTS  CONTROL  OF  MVS,  JES2 OR OTHER SUBSYSTEMS.
          SPECIFICALLY, THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD ALLOWS A NETWORK OPERATOR
          TO  ISSUE MVS, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM COMMANDS, AND RETRIEVE RESPONSES
          AT THE NCCF TERMINAL.  THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD IS A  COMPLETELY
          SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE TSO VERSION. THIS COMMAND PROCESSOR USES
          STANDARD NCCF AND TSSO FACILITIES TO ALLOW AN  NCCF  OPERATOR  TO
          ISSUE  OPERATING  SYSTEM  COMMANDS  AND  RETRIEVE  RESPONSES. THE
          COMMAND INSTALLS DIRECTLY  INTO  THE  NCCF  LOAD  LIBRARY,  OR  A
          CONCATENATED DATASET, AND IS DEFINED TO NCCF IN THE DSICMD MEMBER
          OF THE NCCF PARAMETER DATA SET.

          IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOLLOWING POINTS:

            A.  THE NCCF AND TSO VERSIONS OF OSCMD SHARE THE SAME  POOL  OF
                SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES. WHEN DEFINING THE NUMCONS PARAMETER, IT
                IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE NUMBER  OF  SIMULTANEOUS  NCCF
                USERS THAT WILL BE USING TSSO FACILITIES.

            B.  NCCF DOES NOT REQUIRE APF  AUTHORIZATION  BECAUSE  OF  THIS
                FACILITY.  THIS  IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT OSCMD DOES INDEED
                RUN WITH APF AUTHORIZATION. TSSO GRANTS  APF  AUTHORIZATION
                TO  THE  NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD THROUGH THE USE OF MVS CROSS
                MEMORY SERVICES. TSSO PROVIDES A NEW OPERATOR COMMAND  (#.Q
                XMEM) TO MONITOR THE CROSS MEMORY ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS A
                DEBUG OPTION TO DISPLAY WHEN THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD  HAS
                CALLED THE TSSO CROSS MEMORY SERVICES ROUTINE.

                THIS AUTHORIZATION METHOD IS  CONTRASTED  WITH  IBM'S  OCCF
                PRODUCT,  WHICH  REQUIRES  ALL DATASETS IN THE NCCF STEPLIB
                CONCATENATION TO BE IN THE APF AUTHORIZATION LIST.

            C.  TSSO ASSUMES THAT ALL NCCF USERS ARE  AUTHORIZED  TO  ISSUE
                MVS  MASTER CONSOLE COMMANDS. A USER EXIT IS PROVIDED IF AN
                INSTALLATION WISHES TO ALTER  THIS  DEFAULT.  THE  EXIT  IS
                PASSED THE NCCF USER IDENTIFIER.

            D.  THE TSSO/NCCF OSCMD FACILITY FULLY SUPPORTS THE USE OF  THE
                NCCF  ROUTE  COMMAND.  THIS ALLOWS REMOTE OPERATOR TO ROUTE
                MVS, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM  COMMANDS  TO  REMOTE  SYSTEMS,  AND
                RETRIEVE THE RESPONSES. THIS FACILITY MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR
                AN OPERATOR TO CONTROL (OR AT LEAST MONITOR) MANY MVS HOSTS
                FROM ONE NCCF CONSOLE.

          TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY SAF INTERFACE

          THE TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY COMPONENT IS ENHANCED TO USE THE SYSTEM
          ACCESS  FACILITY  (SAF)  INTERFACE. ALL CALLS MADE BY TSSO TO THE
          RACF SECURITY SYSTEM WERE  REPLACED  BY  SAF  CALLS.  RACF  USERS
          SHOULD  NOTICE  NO  DIFFERENCES  BECAUSE OF THIS ENHANCEMENT. TOP
          SECRET USERS SHOULD ALSO BE UNAFFECTED.  THE  ENHANCEMENT  ALLOWS
          FOR  ACF2  SUPPORT  TO BE PROVIDED USING STANDARD MVS FACILITIES.
          ACF2 USERS WILL  NEED  ACF2  VERSION  4.1  TO  SUPPORT  THIS  NEW
          FEATURE.  NOTE  THAT ACF2 SUPPORT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT,
          AND IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE BASE TSSO 4.3 CODE.

          RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO TSSO TO ENHANCE IT'S
          RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILITY (RAS).

            1.  TSSO NO LONGER ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO START TSSO IF  IT  IS
                ALREADY  UP. PREVIOUS RELEASES OF TSSO WOULD ALLOW NUMEROUS
                "INCARNATIONS" OF TSSO  ADDRESS  SPACES  TO  EXIST  IN  THE
                SYSTEM.

            2.  SINCE IT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME NECESSARY TO  FORCE  START
                TSSO  (E.G.   DEFEAT THE ABOVE FEATURE), A NEW PARAMETER IS
                AVAILABLE IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE START  COMMAND  USED  TO
                START  TSSO.  IF  THE  PARAMETER BEGINS WITH A SLASH ('/'),
                TSSO WILL RESTART OVER ITSELF.

            3.  TSSO ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO SPECIFY INITIALIZATION  "PROMPT"
                MODE  AS AN OPERAND ON THE START COMMAND. TSSO WILL GO INTO
                "PROMPT" MODE IF AN "*" IS DETECTED  IMMEDIATELY  PRIOR  TO
                THE  PARMLIB MEMBER SPECIFICATION ON THE START COMMAND. FOR
                EXAMPLE, THE COMMAND

                   S TSSO,PARM='*TSSODECK'


                WILL     START     TSSO     USING      PARAMETERS      FROM
                'SYS1.PARMLIB(TSSODECK)',  AND  PLACE TSSO IN "PROMPT" MODE
                FOLLOWING THE READING OF THE PARAMETER INPUT. THE COMMAND


                  S TSSO,PARM='*'


                WILL FORCE TSSO INTO PROMPT MODE AFTER  READING  PARAMETERS
                FROM THE DEFAULT INITIALIZATION DECK (TSSOPARM).  NOTE THAT
                IF BOTH NEW OPERANDS (PROMPT  MODE  AND  FORCE  START)  ARE
                REQUIRED,  THE '/' MUST BE SPECIFIED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE
                '*', FOLLOWED  BY  THE  NAME  OF  THE  SYS1.PARMLIB  MEMBER











          MEMORANDUM FOR FILE - 7                        SEPTEMBER 16, 1986




                SPECIFYING TSSO PARAMETERS.

            4.  TSSO NOW CONTAINS A MODULE THAT WILL GET CONTROL AT MVS IPL
                TIME,  AND OBTAIN STORAGE FOR A NEW CONTROL BLOCK, THE TSSO
                NON DISRUPTABLE SYSTEM AREA (TSSONDSA). THIS CONTROL  BLOCK
                KEEPS STATUS FLAGS ACROSS TSSO RESTARTS. INSTALLATIONS MUST
                MAKE A SMALL CHANGE TO THE IEFSSNXX MEMBER OF  SYS1.PARMLIB
                TO SUPPORT THIS CHANGE.

                IF THIS CHANGE IS NOT MADE, TSSO WILL INITIALIZE THIS FIELD
                WHEN STARTED, HOWEVER, THE BENEFITS FROM THE NEXT FEATURE
                (#5) WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

            5.  TSSO WILL NOW DEFAULT TO USE THE PRIMARY SUBSYSTEM (JES2 OR
                JES3)  FOR  SERVICES.  IN  PREVIOUS  RELEASES  OF TSSO, THE
                SUB=JES2 COMMAND NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED ON THE START COMMAND
                FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE COMMAND


                   S TSSO,SUB=MSTR


                WILL  ALLOW  TSSO  TO  INITIALIZE   WITHOUT   THE   PRIMARY
                SUBSYSTEM.

            6.  TSSO  4.3  NOW  SUPPORTS  RESTART  PROCESSING.  IF  IT   IS
                NECESSARY  TO  FORCE  START  TSSO (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE), THE
                INACTIVE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE MAY BE CANCELLED. NOTE THAT THE
                INACTIVE  TSSO  DOES NOT RELINQUISH ITS SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES,
                AND THEREFORE, IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO  FORCE  START  UNLESS
                ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

            7.  THE TSSO INITIALIZATION ROUTINE IS COMPLETELY REWRITTEN FOR
                TSSO  4.3.  THE  NEW  ROUTINE  ONLY  ACCESSES KEY ZERO WHEN
                ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED.

          CONCLUSION

          THIS DOCUMENT SUMMARIZES THE ENHANCEMENTS MADE TO TSSO IN VERSION
          4.3.  ANY  AND  ALL COMMENTS, COMPLAINTS, SUGGESTIONS OR REQUESTS
          MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE AUTHOR AT (201) 981-2796.
