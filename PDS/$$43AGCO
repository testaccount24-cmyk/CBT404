When I finally settled down to a permanent job in Blighty it was at a
greenfield MVS site (OS/390 2.6) to replace a VM network machine.
Although Netview(TM) was in use for network automation there was no
product doing MVS console automation.  As a quick and dirty fix I
installed TSSO as modified by Guy Albertelli to run under OS/390.  I
knew and loved TSSO of old.  I liked what Guy had done to the AOF table
but I eventually discovered that there was a downside; the Boolean logic
I had added while at Sprecher Energie had been deliberately excised.
This was fine for simplicity, but the AOF processing that I had built
for IEF238D now resulted in replies of both WAIT and CANCEL, with the
same reply id.  Fortunately it was fairly easy to change TSSOSS09 to   -
reinstate the SEAG logic, Guy's version is retained as member XSSOSS09.


*****   AOF Table Processing.


TSSO 4.3++ processing of the AOF table is as follows:
  -When table is loaded (or reloaded) a binary search index is
   created based on the MSG= parameter. All identical entries are
   chained together. All MSG=* entries are chained together.
  -Major and minor WQEs processed.
  -For each message processed, the binary index is searched and if
   found, the chained entries are processed until a matching entry
   is found with no entry id.
  -All messages are also passed to all MSG=* entries.


The MSG=* entries are still  processed after all other entries are
processed.

I have added eXclusion tests to Word and Substring processing, giving
options WX and SX. That is, if the specified Word or Substring is found
the test is deemed to have failed. This was prompted by jobs failing
at End of Memory causing two error messages - one for the job, one for
the Initiator. I was not interested in the message for the Initiator,
as this example shows;

********************************************************************
* HIGHLIGHT JOBS THAT TERMINATE AT END OF MEMORY
* 17OCT02 DHC   CAN HAPPEN AFTER MANY MANY WAIT/NOHOLD MESSAGES
********************************************************************
         TABENTRY MSG=$HASP310,ACTION=HILIGHT,
               TEST=((WX,2,4,'INIT',''''))



****    Other Modifications

REPLY, REPLYLOA
I didn't see how REPLYLOA could work, so I gave up trying and looked
for another way to get the CMB chains.  In file 19 of the CBT tape I
found another reply type program which contained a csect called REPLY.
This did what I wanted, so I grafted it in.  To avoid confusion I kept
the name REPLY for the TSSO version, John Hooper's code was renamed
LIONRPLY. Guy's REPLYLOA is there as REPLYLOB.

CLIST
I added a couple of CLISTS that I find useful plus an example of their
usage.  I put these at the end of the CLISTS member, out of alphabetic
sequence.  I think IEBUPDTE etc. can handle this, if not I'm sorry.

The sterling work of Guy Albertelli, Jim Lane and John Hooper is
gratefully acknowledged, as is the most recent contribution by a
New England site.
