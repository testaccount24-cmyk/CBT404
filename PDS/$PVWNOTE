$PVWNOTE as of December, 2002                                   PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
My changes include the following:                               PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
1) Updated TSSOCCMD to correct a problem of the RELOAD command. PVW1202
   TSSOCCMD has been updated to change back into a non-zero     PVW1202
   key before issuing the DELETE of the old AOF table.  When    PVW1202
   done, TSSOCCMD will change back to key zero.                 PVW1202
   TSSO now will properly delete the previous table from        PVW1202
   global storage before attempting to load the new table in.   PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
2) Added program TSSORATH (and updated programs ALTAOF and      PVW1202
   CACHE) to call this program.  TSSORATH will call SAF to      PVW1202
   verify access to the FACILITY class profile TSSO.CMD.AUTH.   PVW1202
   If found, and the userid has READ access to the profile,     PVW1202
   skip around the logic to check the userdata field in uads.   PVW1202
   If the profile is not found, continue and check the uads     PVW1202
   field (as it currently works).                               PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
3) Update TABENTRY and TSSOSS09 to allow for another action     PVW1202
   specification of MSGRED.  When MSGRED is specified, the      PVW1202
   message will be hilighted in red on the console.             PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
                                                                PVW1202
