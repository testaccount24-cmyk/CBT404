Hi Sam/Sam,

I have attached a copy of the SPMON program from File 404 (TSSO),
that allows it to work (and not get an 0C4).  The newer versions
of the operating system can't rely on LOCASCB always returning a
valid ASCB just because there is something in R1.  You are
supposed to test R15 to make sure that a valid and used ASCB was
returned.  In the case of the old SPMON program, it just checked
how many ASIDs were possible and then just asked for the first
through the last, assuming that if R1 came back with a non-zero
address, that everything was fine, but that bypasses the
possibility of a address space that had abended or had been
reused.  There is still a small problem where the address spaces
that are started via OMVS (SYSLOGD1 and FTPD1 etc.) have the
ASCBJBNI field with a name in it instead of the ASCBJBNS field,
but IBM claims that this is because they are truly "initiated"
address spaces and not "true" STC's, so I'll have to add some
code to look into the initiation method at some future date, but
I thought that it might be good to have a version of the module
that doesn't get an 0C4, so I have attached it.
