Hi Sam,

I have another small update for the CBTTAPE file 404, the wonderful
TSSO system.  I have modifed TSSOSS09 program to allow the
insertion of the system ID of the system that issued the message,
when running in a sysplex.

I have attached both versions,  $$PREZ18 and post 1.8.  But
unfortunately I only have this on a pre-1.8 system.  You might
want to have someone test out the  post 1.8 version just to make
sure it works before publishing it.

Here is a small update to the user guide under the TEXT operand:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To insert the system ID of the issuing system in a SYSPLEX, use
the format:

   \Iabcdnn\
     ______

 where abcdnn are optional and ignored.  The trailing '\' must be
specified.

 For example, to route a command to the system that issued a
message, you need to insert the SYSTEM ID into the ROUTE command,
The TABENTRY macro would look like this:

   entry-id TABENTRY MSG=IEF176I,ACTION=OSCMD,
   ________
                  TEXT='RO \I001,01\P \W    03\'


 Multiple "I" "S" and "W" options can be used in one TEXT operand.
If AOF  detects an error in the TEXT parameter as a result of a S
or W option, a message is issued and processing is terminated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope someone can find this useful, please let me know if you have
any questions.

Regards,
Dana
