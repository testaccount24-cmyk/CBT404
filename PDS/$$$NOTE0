                    Packaging of this PDS
                    --------- -- ---- ---

Elimination of the Master Console in z/OS 1.8 has made for some
incompatible changes to TSSO.  Therefore, I didn't want to mix up
the old, pre-z/OS 1.8 code, with the TSSO code that was fixed for
z/OS 1.8 (by Larry Lawler, aka Dr. CICS).

Therefore, I have done an extreme bit of packaging, by lumping up
the entire File 404, as it existed previously, into one pds member
called $$PREZ18.  If you have a z/OS system at 1.7 or lower, then
you are welcome to run the $PDSLOAD job member, to create an install
pds to install the previous TSSO 4.4 code.  Otherwise, this entire
pds is tailored for z/OS 1.8 and higher.

Much thanks to Larry Lawler for doing the latest work.

All the best to all of you......
