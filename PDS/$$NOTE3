Thanks all!

I dug around and found the answer in TSSORATH (sp?). One, this program
was not in the 'all assembly' list which drew my attention in the first
place.

There I found a RACF check for a facility. I don't recall seeing that in
the instructions anywhere. Anyway, I added the FACILITY and the problem
went away. The root problem was a poorly worded error message.

This was one of two modules not included in the 'all assembly' member.
The other was LION something.

Another question: where might I find doc on the variables passed to the
CLIST?

Yet another: I saw a fleeting reference to REXX. Is REXX supported? How
about the variables?

  Note from Sam Golob:  I tried running Mark Zelden's IPLINFO REXX
       under TSSO and it produced console output.  So a REXX exec
       can indeed be run under TSSO.  I think the reason is that
       TSSO invokes "real TSO" for command execution, so any command
       that "real TSO" can execute, will also be OK under TSO, as
       long as the output is in line mode, and not fullscreen mode.
       And also, you will see the output on the console if it was
       produced by TSO PUTLINE processing, as opposed to TPUT.  REXX
       and CLIST outputs are produced by PUTLINE.

       Also please note that if no output is produced by a TSO
       command, as when you use the TSO RENAME command, the command
       will still do its job under TSSO, the same way it will do its
       job under TSO.  The dataset will be renamed, even though there
       will be no output produced.

       (All this is "very cool" since it must be remembered that TSSO
       in its present form, was written in 1986, and as modified by
       Ed Jaffe and others, it runs nicely under z/OS.  I tested TSSO
       at the z/OS 1.7 level.)

By the way, the product went from download to operational in a day and a
half (I was allowed a prime time IPL on that LPAR). That LPAR is now
serving a critical DR mission and TSSO is a key to accomplishing that
mission. Awesome tool!!

Hi,

Assuming you are using the default JCL delivered with file 404 to
assemble/link it, you have to make sure that the library you linked it
into is APF authorized.  You can temporarily authorize it with the
SETPROG command, but make sure that you also place it in your PROGxx
member for the next time you IPL.

I've had a couple of people contact me offline about this same problem
recently, and it has always been (so far) that they either didn't
authorize the library in the first place, or they only used SETPROG and
then when they IPLed, the authorization was lost because they forgot to
update the correct PROGxx member.

If you have concatenated the STEPLIB that TSSO is using, you must make
sure that all of the libraries in the concatenation are authorized.

Brian

I have the latest version of TSSO installed on a z/os 1.7 system.
Testing is going well, but I am a bit baffled by the error message:



ALTAOF IS TERMINATING BECAUSE IT WAS NOT INVOKED AUTHORIZED





The entry is in IKJTSO01. Other TSSO commands/functions seem to be
working just fine. What am I missing?



Thanks!!!
