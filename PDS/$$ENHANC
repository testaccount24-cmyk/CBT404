Note from Sam Golob

The following is an enhancement suggestion for TSSO which I have
chosen NOT to introduce into the main source code.  However, it is
here for the picking, and if you want it, you can use it.....

The code comes from Larry Lawler, who has fixed TSSO for z/OS 1.8.

Just found another thing I changed back in November, that I used
to figure out was was going wrong.  It is not needed for
successful execution, but was very useful for debugging, the
messages look like this:

TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON0
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON1
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON2
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON3
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON4
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON5
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON6
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON7
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON8
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON9

The code by the way violates "rent" check in assembly (rc=04), but works.
It is 2 statements right after label REQOK in module TSSOGSSC:

         ST    R11,WORKAREA             PUT PARM LIST AWAY
GET_NEXT_CNSL  EQU *                                         11/19/2006
         LA    R1,WORKAREA              LOAD ADDRESS OF WHERE IT IS.
         LINK  EP=IEAVG700              ** DO IT **
         LTR   R15,R15
         BZ    REQOK

It is your call, if you want to use it or not.  I was having
problems because my MVS sysprog, fat fingered the TSSO subsystem
console definitions in sys1.parmlib, and had two TSSOCON8(S) and
no TSSOCON9.  So mvs threw out the duplicate at IPL time, and
TSSO complained there were NO subsystem consoles defined for its
use.  Yup, the message was NO, not something more useful, such as
one is missing or something like that.  This made me think it was
yet another IBM changed to the console interface in zos 1.7, and
I never thought it might be my sysprog mistake.  Any way the
messages helped me pinpoint his parmlib mistake.

Thank You,

Larry Lawler
