Hi Sam,

I came across another small problem during implementing TSSO when
using the MLWTO Line test:   TEST=((L,9),  in the AOFTable.
Running on z/OS 1.4 I was getting messages:  TSS9208E ERROR
PROCESSING L DIRECTIVE- ENTRY IGNORED     and on z/OS 1.11, it
would generate a S0C4:

DUMP TITLE=COMPON=SSI,COMPID=5752SC1B6,ISSUER=IEFJSARR,MODULE=IEFJRASP,
           ABEND=S0C4,REASON=00000011,SNAME=TSSO

The problem seems to be in TSSOSS09, after label SEDOLMXX the
reference to WMNMNX2 is using R5 as it s base, due to the USING
WMNM,R5 statement even though it branches around the load of it s
address into R5.  By moving the POP USING to directly after
SEDOLMXX, R10 is still used for the ICM  R15,B1111,WMNMNX2
correctly:

SEDOLMXX DS    0H                  CONTINUE PROCESSING
         POP   USING               Moved here                      RPS
         ICM   R15,B'1111',WMNMNX2 IS THERE ANOTHER MINOR?
         BZ    SEDOLMX2            NO, A REAL EXIT
         LR    R5,R15              YES, UPDATE POINTER
         B     SEDOLM1             GO ROUND THE LIST OF MINOR WQE'S
*        POP   USING               Move up                         RPS
         SPACE 1

Interestingly enough, this jumped out at me, mostly due to the
list of the active usings, across the top of the page of the
HLASM output, showing WMJM going from R10 to R5.   Thanks to the
SLAC mods,    I remember discussing the SLAC mods at a SHARE BOF
with you many years ago ..

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thank you
Dana

   Note from Sam Golob:  I made this change in both the new TSSO
             and the old TSSO.

   Note from Sam Golob:  HLASM was created because of the SLAC
   (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) mods to Assembler H
   (written by Greg Mushial).  Greg invented the concepts of
   Labeled Usings and all the other extra concepts and features
   (more than what IEV90 had) which were initially incorporated
   into HLASM after IBM took over support of the SLAC mods (in
   1992).
