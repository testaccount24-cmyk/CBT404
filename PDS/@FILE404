//*       Updated by John McKown to no longer require that the      *   FILE 404

//*           The Time Sharing Subsystem Option (TSSO) is a         *   FILE 404
//*           package designed to increase operator productivity    *   FILE 404
//*           by automating tasks which need not be performed       *   FILE 404
//*           manually.  TSSO performs its function through three   *   FILE 404
//*           integrated components.  The Operator Productivity     *   FILE 404
//*           Facility (OPF) extends the power of TSO to the        *   FILE 404
//*           MVS operator's console.  The Automated Operations     *   FILE 404
//*           Facility (AOF) enhances an installation's             *   FILE 404
//*           ability to control system events based on console     *   FILE 404
//*           message traffic.  An interface to the Network         *   FILE 404
//*           Communication Control Facility (NCCF) allows the      *   FILE 404
//*           network operator to use TSSO as a command processor,  *   FILE 404
//*           issuing and receiving operating system commands at    *   FILE 404
//*           the NCCF terminal.  Note that NCCF is now an inte-    *   FILE 404

//*           Anyone with an interest in automated operations is    *   FILE 404
//*           invited to look at TSSO as a software tool providing  *   FILE 404
//*           many of the primitives required for common automated  *   FILE 404
//*           operations tasks.  These primitives include the       *   FILE 404
//*           hilighting, lowlighting, replying and reacting to     *   FILE 404
//*           operating system messages.  This is in addition to    *   FILE 404
//*           the ability to issue a command and retrieve the       *   FILE 404
//*           response in CLIST variables.                          *   FILE 404

//*         The purpose of these modifications is to allow TSSO     *   FILE 404
//*         to handle automated message processing with multi-      *   FILE 404
//*         line WTO's and to do other new functions.  File 402     *   FILE 404
//*         has been merged into TSSO 4.3 by Guy Albertelli.  So    *   FILE 404
//*         it's probably best to ignore File 402 and install       *   FILE 404
//*         File 404 instead, which is an OS/390 upgrade of the     *   FILE 404
