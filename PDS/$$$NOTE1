Hello,

I changed two lines in TSSOSS09.

At line 10130004 after the AFTECHO1 label, I changed "LH
R0,MASTCONS" to "SR R0,R0".  I made the same change at line
11140006 after label ISSUERPL.

I don't claim to be an SVC 34 expert.  I based this change on the
fact that, according to the 1.9 "Authorized Assembler Reference",
the MGCR macro requires register 0 be set to low values.  Since
it was 3:55 PM on Friday and we planned on implementing z/OS 1.9
the following Sunday (today), I didn't delve into why register 0
is supposed to be cleared I just cleared it and it worked.
Obviously, it has something to do with the console ID, but I'm
not sure what.  Hopefully, z/OS 1.9 will behave and I'll have
time to play with this more next week.

Thanks again for your help,
Carey

Hi Carey,

   Would you please send your correction to me, so that I can post it
with the source code for TSSO on File 404?  Thanks much, in advance.
I'd like to correct this on the collection, so the "next guy" won't have
any problems.  Again, thanks......

   All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,    Sam

Thanks for your reply.  I posted a reply to the list this morning.

The latest version corrected all the problems with the exception
of the AOF facility.  All responses to WTORs failed with the
message:

IEE703I REPLY 12 NOT REQUESTED FROM THIS CONSOLE
I ended up making a slight modification to TSSOSS09.  I cleared
register 0 prior to the SVC 34 call.  This seemed to correct the
problem for us.

Thanks again,
Carey

Hi Carey,

   Did you try the latest TSSO on File 404 on the Updates page of
www.cbttape.org?  It required quite a few changes to be able to run on
z/OS 1.8, with the elimination of the "master console concept" there,
and with a few other system changes necessary.

   I haven't tried it on 1.9 yet, but I'd start with the version that
works for 1.8.

   Please stay in touch.

   All the best of everything to all of you.

Sincerely,    Sam Golob
