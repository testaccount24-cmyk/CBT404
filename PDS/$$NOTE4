Subject:     Additional changes to make TSSO support for zOS 1.8,
             to handle "UNKNOWN" consoles in TSSOSS09

Hello Sam:

    Sorry to "Bother" you but, a user of TSSO contacted me with a
problem using TSSO's OS2CMD facility, not displaying the response
messages, although the command was working.  Seems the fullword
console IDs in the WQE contained x'00FFFFFF' instead of a valid
SUBSYS CNSL ID!

In the process I found one Mistake in my previous Changes
(another line was supposed to be commented out) The problem he
was having is the output from the OS2CMD was not being return
correctly by TSSOSS09 (JES subsystem module)

Anyway while trying to debug the code, I also Improved upon my
previous WTO logic in TSSOGSSC, to add the Console id Numbers to
the WTO Message.  This was so I could tell what was wrong between
TSSOSS09 and OS2CMD.  Any way here are the source changes to the
three TSSO modules:


In Module: TSSO I had to comment out one more line, in this code:


         XR    R15,R15
* drcics ICM   R14,15,UCMMCENT      GET ADDR OF UCM OF MASTC 11/19/2006
* drcics BZ    HRDCONS              IF NONE THEN USE MASTCON 11/19/2006
         USING UCMLIST,R14                                      29OCT92
         IC    R15,UCMID            GET THE CONSOLE ID
HRDCONS  DS    0H                                               29OCT92

to look like this:

         XR    R15,R15
* drcics ICM   R14,15,UCMMCENT      GET ADDR OF UCM OF MASTC 11/19/2006
* drcics BZ    HRDCONS              IF NONE THEN USE MASTCON 11/19/2006
         USING UCMLIST,R14                                      29OCT92
* drcics IC    R15,UCMID            GET THE CONSOLE ID       06/20/2007
HRDCONS  DS    0H                                               29OCT92



IN TSSOGSSC I changed my previous WTO code that looked like this:

         MVC   WTO_CNSL+4+4+35(8),SCSONAME CNSL NAME RETURNED11/19/2006
WTO_CNSL WTO   'TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: 12345678',           +
               ROUTCDE=11,MCSFLAG=HRDCPY                     11/19/2006


to this code, to see the subsystem console ID Numbers, to aid in
debugging TSSOSS09

         MVC   WTO_CNSL+4+4+35(8),SCSONAME CNSL NAME RETURNED06/20/2007
         UNPK  WTO_CNSL+4+4+48(9),SCSCONID(5)   CNSL ID#     06/20/2007
         XC    WTO_CNSL+4+4+48(8),=8XL1'F0'     REMOVE SIGNS 06/20/2007
         TR    WTO_CNSL+4+4+48(8),=CL16'0123456789ABCDEF'    06/20/2007
         MVI   WTO_CNSL+4+4+48+8,C' ' BLANK OUT UNPACKED SIGN06/20/2007
WTO_CNSL WTO   'TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: 12345678, ID=1234567+
               8 ',ROUTCDE=11,MCSFLAG=HRDCPY                 06/20/2007


then is TSSOSS09, right after this old code:

         L     R10,SSCONNUM        GET SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE ID
         CR    R6,R10              IS IT OURS ?
         BE    FNDSSCON            BY GOLLY, IT SURE IS...

but before the label: SSCLOOPE, to handle "unknown" subsystem console ids,
These get used internally by TSSO's OS2CMD processing.
         L     R10,SSCONNUM        GET SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE ID
         CR    R6,R10              IS IT OURS ?
         BE    FNDSSCON            BY GOLLY, IT SURE IS...
*                                                            06/20/2007
         CLM   R6,15,=XL4'00FFFFFF'    IS IT UNKNOWN ?       06/20/2007
         BNE   SSCLOOPE            NO, TRY NEXT CONSOLE ENTRY06/20/2007
         CLC   =C'UNKNOWN ',WQECNNME   YES, REALLY UNKNOWN ? 06/20/2007
         BE    FNDSSCON            YES, TREAT IT LIKE OURS   06/20/2007
*                                                            06/20/2007
SSCLOOPE DS    0H

And that's was it, to get him up and running with OS2CMD:

Just found another thing I changed back in November, that I
used to figure out was was going wrong.  It is not needed for
successful execution, but was very useful for debugging, the
messages look like this:

TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON0
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON1
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON2
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON3
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON4
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON5
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON6
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON7
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON8
TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: TSSOCON9

The code by the way violates "rent" check in assembly (rc=04),
but works fine, it is 2 statements right after label REQOK in
module TSSOGSSC:

         ST    R11,WORKAREA             PUT PARM LIST AWAY
GET_NEXT_CNSL  EQU *                                         11/19/2006
         LA    R1,WORKAREA              LOAD ADDRESS OF WHERE IT IS.
         LINK  EP=IEAVG700              ** DO IT **
         LTR   R15,R15
         BZ    REQOK


REQOK    DS    0H
         L     R2,SCSCONID            GET CONSOLE ID         02/08/2007
         ST    R2,TSSCONID            PUT IN TSSO CVT.       02/08/2007
*
         CLC   =C'TSSO',SCSONAME       IS THIS OUR PREFIX ?  11/19/2006
         BNE   GET_NEXT_CNSL           NO, THEN GET NEXT ONE 11/19/2006
         MVC   WTO_CNSL+4+4+35(8),SCSONAME CNSL NAME RETURNED11/19/2006
WTO_CNSL WTO   'TSSG000I CONSOLE NAME RETURNED IS: 12345678',           +
               ROUTCDE=11,MCSFLAG=HRDCPY                     11/19/2006



It is your call, if you want to use it or not.  I was having
problems because my MVS sysprog, fat fingered the TSSO subsystem
console definitions in sys1.parmlib, and had two TSSOCON8(S) and
no TSSOCON9.  So mvs threw out the duplicate at IPL time, and
TSSO complained there were NO subsystem consoles defined for its
use.  Yup, the message was NO, not something more useful, such as
one is missing or something like that.  This made me think it was
yet another IBM changed to the console interface in zos 1.7, and
I never thought it might be my sysprog's mistake.  Any way the
messages helped me pinpoint his parmlib mistake.

Thank You,

Larry Lawler

Hi Larry,

   When I applied your changes and assembled, I noticed that you
   didn't have a change to TSSOSS09, which reflected the
   elimination of the symbol WQEUCMID.  Did you have some logic
   that handled this change correctly?  How did the assembly work
   on your system?

   Thanks in advance.

   All the best........

     collection, I have to "regression test" the changes on the
     older releases of MVS to make sure that they still work, and
     if they don't work, I have to repackage as two separate
     sources.  I'll try and let you know how it comes out.
     Thanks for finding and making the fixes.
