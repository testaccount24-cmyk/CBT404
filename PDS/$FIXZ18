The basic problem is that TSSO has not been updated for changes
caused by the z/OS Console Restructure.  Specifically, in z/OS R8
the Master Console function was removed.  As a result, the symbol
UCMMCENT no longer exists.  The TSSO logic needs to be reworked
so that it no longer depends on the presence of the Master
Console.  As I recall, the WQEUCMID field was a 1-byte console ID
field.  That too has gone away. TSSO needs to be updated to use
4-byte console IDs exclusively.
