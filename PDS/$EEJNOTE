$EEJNOTE as of November, 2002                                   EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
TSSO is a useful program. It also provides numerous examples    EEJ1102
of extremely poor assembler programming techniques. It uses     EEJ1102
hard-coded offsets, redundant list/execute macro parameters,    EEJ1102
sparse comments, multiple base registers, hard-coded lengths    EEJ1102
for dynamically-acquired storage, etc., etc.                    EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
If I was responsible for this program and/or getting paid to    EEJ1102
maintain it, I would clean all of this up (it would probably    EEJ1102
take weeks to do so). Instead, I implemented my modifications   EEJ1102
attempting to change as little of the underlying source as      EEJ1102
possible. In some cases, that means I replaced one hard-coded   EEJ1102
offset with another. (Yuck!)                                    EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
I have included member $EEJSUPC to show what source changes     EEJ1102
were made by me. It is a SuperC comparison of all modules       EEJ1102
before and after my changes. I used the TSO/E XMIT command      EEJ1102
to make it fit in an LRECL=80 member.                           EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
My changes include the following:                               EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
1) Support for MCS Extended and SMCS consoles.                  EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
 o TSSO relied heavily on looking up the console UCM to get     EEJ1102
   its authority. I now obtain the authority from the SSCM      EEJ1102
   and have removed most (but not all) access to the console    EEJ1102
   UCM. EMCS consoles do not have UCM entries.                  EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
 o I changed all console-related messages to display the        EEJ1102
   console name rather than the console ID (except for the      EEJ1102
   subsystem allocatable consoles). Usually, EMCS consoles      EEJ1102
   do not have 1-byte IDs associated with them.                 EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
 o I reworked all WTOs destined to a specific console to use    EEJ1102
   the CONSID= parameter rather than MCSFLAG=REG0 (which does   EEJ1102
   not support 4-byte console IDs).                             EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
 o I reworked all routines that issue commands from specific    EEJ1102
   consoles to use MGCRE with the CONSID= parameter. This       EEJ1102
   provides command support for the 4-byte console IDs.         EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
 o I removed the requirement that consoles be logged on to      EEJ1102
   TSSO to issue non-TSSO commands with SECLEVEL=MAXIMAL. MCS   EEJ1102
   already has a logon facility for consoles (but it didn't     EEJ1102
   when TSSO was first written) and the TSSO behavior           EEJ1102
   prevented consoles from logging on via MCS. Since SMCS       EEJ1102
   consoles *must* logon, TSSO prevented them from being used   EEJ1102
   in a z/OS environment. With SECLEVEL=MAXIMAL, consoles must  EEJ1102
   still logon to TSSO to use TSSO facilities, but the use of   EEJ1102
   other facilities is now unaffected.                          EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
2) Support for 4-byte reply IDs. The program assumed all reply  EEJ1102
   IDs were two bytes long and could not process messages with  EEJ1102
   3- or 4-byte reply IDs.                                      EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
3) A new TMPNAME= startup parameter to allow a TMP other than   EEJ1102
   IKJEFT01 to be used when issuing TSO commands via TSSO.      EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
4) Some minor bug fixes. The original version I obtained in     EEJ1102
   1998 had lots of problems. Before putting my changes on      EEJ1102
   the CBT tape, I extracted the "current" version which had    EEJ1102
   many of those problems solved by others. I retrofitted my    EEJ1102
   changes as necessary to the current version. Any coding I    EEJ1102
   performed in 1998 to solve problems that no longer exist     EEJ1102
   was discarded.                                               EEJ1102
                                                                EEJ1102
Enjoy!                                                          EEJ1102
